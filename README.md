# nic.edu.pl
a placeholder page in place of polands' educational registry (NIC)

### there should definitely be legal concerns with this, right?
uhh, *<sup>likely</sup>* *<sup>ⁿᵒᵗ??</sup>* <br>
it expired 4 days prior to writing this and it was used as a temporary .edu email. there was seemingly never an actual registry there due to second and third level tlds often not having official registars<br>

this domain has the highest amount of tlds it was registered under (1.5k), and nothing else even comes close. <br>
the closest one seems to be "com" with 743 tlds.. the rest of the top 10 for comparison: <br>
